Troubleshooting
===============

General
-------

* **Q:** How do I install `.whl` files?

  **A:** `.whl` are *Python Wheels* archives, which you can install using pip (>= 1.4). See also `this website <http://pythonwheels.com/>`_.


Debian
------

* **Q:** On a headless Debian server, building a classifier can result in Python exiting, printing the error message
  `GConf Error: Failed to contact configuration server; some possible causes are that you need to enable TCP/IP
  networking for ORBit, or you have stale NFS locks due to a system crash. See http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/
  for information. (Details -  1: Not running within active session)`. How to fix?

  **A:** According to `this <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1421498/linux-gedit-i-always-get-gconf-error-failed-to-contact-configuration-server>`_
  post, set the following environment variable:

  .. code-block:: bash

     export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=""

  And make sure that the `~/.dbus` directory has 0700 as permission mask.


Ubuntu
------

* **Q:** On a headless Ubuntu server, building a classifier can result in Python exiting, printing the error message
  `GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'org.gnome.system.proxy' is not installed`. How to fix?

  **A:** Simply run the following command to fix this:
  `sudo apt-get install gsettings-desktop-schemas`


Mac OSX
-------

* **Q:** Why does javabridge fail with compiler error `clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd'`?

  **A:** XCode 5.1 changed how unknown arguments are handled and now treats them  as error (`source <http://bruteforce.gr/bypassing-clang-error-unknown-argument.html>`_). You can precede the `pip install javabridge` command with the following environment variable:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ARCHFLAGS="-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future" pip install javabridge

* **Q:** Compiling javabridge fails with missing `jni.h` header file - what now?

  **A:** You will need an Oracle JDK installed for this. `Download <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>`_ and install one. Below is a command-line that uses the `jni.h` header file that comes with `1.7.0_45`:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ARCHFLAGS="-I/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/include/ -I/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/include/darwin" pip install --user javabridge

  *PS:* You may need to combine the `ARCHFLAGS` setting with the one from the previous Q&A.

* **Q:** When I use `import javabridge` in my Python shell, a
  dialog pops up, telling me that I don't have Java installed. However, I have
  an Oracle JDK installed. What's wrong?

  **A:** Java environments that are not from Apple don't seem to get picked up
  by Python correctly. Simply install the Java 1.6 that Apple supplies on your
  system as well.

* **Q:** Installing `pygraphviz` fails, because it cannot find the library or
  its includes. What now?

  **A:** Here is what to do:
    * Make sure that you have the `GraphViz <http://graphviz.org/Download_macos.php>`_ 
      package installed.

    * If the installer is still not finding the libraries, download the 
      `pygraphviz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz>`_ sources from PyPi and 
      extract them.

    * Open the `setup.py` file in a text editor and set the `library_path` and
      `include_path` variables to the correct paths on your machine, e.g.,
      `library_path=/usr/local/lib/graphviz` and
      `include_path=/usr/local/include/graphviz` and save the file.

    * Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `setup.py` file
      is located that you just edited.

    * Install the package using `python setup.py install --user`


* **Q:** Installing `pygraphviz` fails with error message 
  `ld: library not found for -lcgraph`. What is wrong?

  **A:** Apparently, the XCode command-line are not installed. You can install
  them by opening a terminal and running the following command: 
  `xcode-select --install`


Windows
-------

* **Q:** The Windows SDK 7.1 installer fails (eg when behind a proxy). What now?

  **A:** You can download an ISO image of the SDK from
  `here <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442>`_
  (`GRMSDK_EN_DVD.iso` is the 32-bit version and `GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso` is the 64-bit version).
  See `this HOWTO <http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/mount-an-iso-image-in-windows-vista/>`_
  for mounting the ISO image once downloaded.

* **Q:** I cannot display graphs, e.g., generated by J48, as I keep getting the error message `ValueError: Program dot not found in path.` - what can I do?

  **A:** PyGraphviz is just a wrapper for `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ which you
  you need to install separately. Also, you need to add the directory containing the GraphViz binaries, like `dot.exe`, to the `PATH` environment variable, e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Graphviz2.38\\bin` (you may have to log out and back in again for these changes to take effect).
